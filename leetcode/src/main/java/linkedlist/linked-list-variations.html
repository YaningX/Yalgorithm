Introduction</A>

<P>
In this handout, we discuss variations on linked lists:

<UL>
<LI>Doubly-linked lists
</LI>
<LI>Cyclic lists
</LI>
<LI>Dummy nodes
</LI>
<LI>Endogenous lists
</LI>
</UL>
The textbook also does so (section 4.6 on pages 232-234),
and we recommend you read that too.
All these variations (and combinations thereof) are used in
professional practice.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
Doubly-Linked Lists</A>
</H1>

<P>
A traditional (singly-linked) list has just one link per node:
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="linked-list-variations-img2.png"
 ALT="\begin{picture}(120,20)
\put(0,0){\FrameBox(20,20){}}
\put(0,10){\line(1,0){20}}...
...{\line(1,0){20}}
\put(90,5){\vector(1,0){30}}
\put(120,10){\ldots}
\end{picture}">
<BR>
</DIV>
But this makes it infeasible to transverse the list
backwards, such as one may need to do to remove a node.
So <SPAN  CLASS="textit">doubly-linked</SPAN> nodes include <SPAN  CLASS="textit">two</SPAN> links per node:
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="245" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="linked-list-variations-img3.png"
 ALT="\begin{picture}(120,30)
\put(-20,12){\line(0,1){6}}
\put(-21,12){\line(0,1){6}}
...
...ctor(1,0){30}}
\put(90,15){\vector(-1,0){30}}
\put(120,15){\ldots}
\end{picture}">
<BR>
</DIV>
A typical node declaration is as follows:<PRE>
private class Node {
  int data;
  Node prev;
  Node next;
  public Node(int d, Node p, Node n) {
    data = d;
    prev = p;
    next = n;
  }
}
</PRE>
When inserting or removing nodes in a doubly-linked list, there are
twice as many links to change as with a singly-linked list.
If your code is ever changing the ``next'' field of some node, it
should probably also be changing the ``prev'' field of a related node.
This property will help you find bugs in your code.
For example, assuming one is inserting a new node at the head of a
link, you might write code as follows:<PRE>
head = new Node(xxx,null,head);
// something is missing!
</PRE>
Here, we created a link from this node to the former ``head'' node
(assuming it is not null), but the ``prev'' link of this new node is
always null because it is first.  However, we are not done and we can
tell that we are not done, because we never set the ``prev'' link of
any existing node.  Indeed the former ``head'' node, if it exists,
needs to point back to this new node:<PRE>
if (head.next != null) {
  head.next.prev = head;
}
</PRE>
The ``prev'' and ``next'' links should be opposites, so that
<!-- MATH
 $x\texttt{.next.prev} = x\texttt{.prev.next} = x$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="264" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="linked-list-variations-img4.png"
 ALT="\( x\texttt{.next.prev} = x\texttt{.prev.next} = x \)"></SPAN>
unless the first link is null.  The above assignment can be need as
effecting this equality.

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
Cyclic Lists</A>
</H1>

<P>
A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">cyclic</SPAN> list is one in which the last node points back to the
first one:
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="49" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="linked-list-variations-img5.png"
 ALT="\begin{picture}(120,30)(0,-10)
\put(0,0){\FrameBox(20,20){}}
\put(0,10){\line(1,...
...){110}}
\put(-5,-2.5){\oval(15,15)[l]}
\put(-5,5){\vector(1,0){5}}
\end{picture}">
<BR>
</DIV>
WIth a cyclic list, we don't use <code>null</code> to terminate a list.
We also don't need a <code>head</code> field; we 
can use the <code>tail</code> field to find the head node.

<P>
Counting the nodes (or any other task that involves looking at all the
nodes) in a cyclic list is somewhat tricky:<PRE>
int count = 0;
if (tail != null) {
  ++count;
  for (Node p = tail.next; p != tail; p = p.next) {
    ++count;
  }
}
</PRE>
We start at the head (<code>tail.next</code>) but as this requires a
dereference, we first must check whether the tail is null.  If it
isn't, then we have to count this node, since the loop will stop when
we reach the tail node.

<P>
Inserting a node at the head of such a list is almost the same as
inserting at the tail.  The only difference is that in the latter
situation, we adjust the ``tail'' pointer to refer to the new node.

<P>
Using cyclic lists reduces the number of cases with null pointers,
which makes for less complex programming for insertions and deletions.
However, there is still the case of the empty list: inserting
something into an empty list, or removing the last node from a list
both involve special cases.

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">
Dummy Nodes</A>
</H1>

<P>
Another way to reduce/remove special cases from linked lists is to use
a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">dummy</SPAN> node, which is a node that does not hold any value, but
is in the list to provide an extra node at the front (and/or rear) of
the list.  So for example, a list with three ``real'' nodes 
with an extra dummy node at the front would
appear as follows:
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="330" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="linked-list-variations-img6.png"
 ALT="\begin{picture}(160,20)(-40,0)
\put(-75,10){\makebox(0,0){head}}
\put(-40,10){\l...
...ne(1,0){30}}
\put(120,2){\line(0,1){6}}
\put(121,2){\line(0,1){6}}
\end{picture}">
<BR>
</DIV>
The dummy node is very useful as a ``lag'' pointer when inserting or
removing nodes.  For instance, if one wants to remove all the nodes
whose data is 0, one can write:<PRE>
Node lag = head;
for (Node p = lag.next; p != null; p = p.next) {
  if (p.data == 0) {
    lag.next = p.next;
  } else {
    lag = p;
  }
}
</PRE>
Without a dummy node, this code is much more complex.

<P>
It is also possible to put a dummy at the end as well,
but more commonly, one uses a dummy node with a cyclic list or even a
cyclic doubly-linked list:
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="336" HEIGHT="65" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="linked-list-variations-img7.png"
 ALT="\begin{picture}(120,30)
\put(-80,15){\makebox(0,0){dummy}}
\put(-40,20){\line(2,...
...150}}
\put(-45,-2.5){\oval(15,15)[l]}
\put(-45,5){\vector(1,0){5}}
\end{picture}">
<BR>
</DIV>
The head of the list can be accessed using <TT>dummy.next</TT> and the
tail by <TT>dummy.prev</TT>.

<P>
When one has a cyclic list with a dummy node (either singly or doubly
linked) there are never any null pointers in the data structure.  This
cuts down the number of cases needed.

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00050000000000000000">
Endogenous Linked Lists</A>
</H1>

<P>
All the linked lists described so far and in the textbook are what we
call <SPAN  CLASS="textit">exogenous</SPAN> linked lists, in which the links are stored
outside of, that is separate from, the data.  We have a separate node
structure used internal to the linked structure.

<P>
However in system programming, one frequently encounters the other
kind of linked list, the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">endogenous</SPAN> linked list, in which the
links are stored within the data.  In other words, the data being
linked already have the ability to be linked together; they already
have (say) ``prev'' and ``next'' fields.
The advantage of such a system is that it does not require one to
allocate new objects (the nodes) in order to connect existing objects
together in lists.  Necessarily each piece can only be placed in one
list.

<P>
In the kernel of an operating system (such as Windows or Linux), there
will be task or process or thread objects.  Each object can be
``runnable'' (in a run qeueue) or waiting in a queue for some event
or some resource.  Removing an object from one queue and inserting
into another doesn't require any object allocation or deallocation,
which is good since kernel code can rarely safely do allocation or
deallocation.
Endogenous lists are also a good match for physical objects that (of
course) can only be in one container at a time.

<P>
Working with endogenous lists is similar to working with exogenous
(traditional) lists except that methods inserting or removing nodes
take the nodes in or return them.  For example, adding a new node at
the head is simple:<PRE>
data.next = head;
head = data;
</PRE>

<P>
Endogenous lists can be singly or doubly linked, and can be cyclic or
acyclic.  They can have dummy nodes as well, but in this case, the
dummy nodes (often called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">sentinels</SPAN>) often must have valid data
fields so that they can function appropriately.
